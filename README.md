## Self-reflection
I learned how to use flexbox to position flex-items on the main axis and the cross axis. I also dealt with a little bit of CSS specificity and how it could lead to unexpected results. When dealing with flex-items, I had to recall how flex-items are bunched up to the start on the main axis and how they stretch along the cross axis in their flex container.
